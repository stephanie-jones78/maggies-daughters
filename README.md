Taking charge of the flailing Independent Order of St. Luke in 1899, Walker transformed the organization into a vibrant and thriving economic engine for blacks. With a vision of economic self-sufficiency, she established a newspaper in 1902, chartered the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903 becoming the first woman bank president in the United States, and opened a store run by and for blacks. Throughout her life, Walker persevered and thrived despite personal, social and professional obstacles. [1]<br>

Maggie Walker was born shortly after the Civil War, to a single black, formerly enslaved woman and white former Confederate soldier. After her Maggie's step-father, the black man her mother who go on to marry, was found dead their family struggled and after starting her own business, her mother saw firsthand the economic gap and disparity between black people and the white patrons she serviced. This lit a fire in Maggie's mother that would lead her to instill into her children a heart for social justice through academic and economic advancement.

# Project Plan
I began the project by collecting event data from various source (see Sources section) in a Google spreadsheet. I plan to tell the story of Maggie Walker through a timeline presentation using Google Sheets to collect the data, Jupyter Notebooks and Python to futher collect, clean, and prepare the data for exploration and visualization, and then a Tableau workbook and possibly Google Slides or Canva for presentation. <br>
1. Learn the story of Maggie Walker and collect data on key events in a Google Sheet document while also learning more about finance and, specifically investment
2. Read the data from the Google Sheet into a Pandas DataFrame using Python into a Jupyter Notbook
3. Clean the data and create a `wrangle.py` module to store functions that make the work reproducible.
4. Perform exploratory analysis and document key findings to be used in the presentation. Create an `explore.py` module to store functions that make the work reproducible.

        1. Can key events in Maggie's Walker's life be grouped in a meaningful way (e.g. Periods: Developmental, Learning, Working, Leaderhip, Retirement, etc.). I am recording the events and giving each event categories and sub-categories so looking at a frequency of categories by binned dates may uncover these insights. <br><br>
        2. Engineering a boolean feature that records an events as a positive or negative and determining how the frequency of positive and negatives may or may not have impacted milestones in her professional and personal life. <br><br>
        3. Looking at that same positive and negative events indicator, were there more positive/negative professional or personal events? (This is somewhat subjective, because we cannot know every event that happened in her life, only those that are documented and, for the purposes of this project, that I am capturing in this dataset)

5. Take conclusions and, using Tableau and/or Canva, create a presentation about Maggie's Walker's life and key takeways about her legacy.
