## About the Bureau of Labor Statistics API
The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Public Data Application Programming Interface (API) gives the public access to economic data from all BLS programs. 
<details>
  <summary>More</summary>The BLS Public Data API is currently available in two versions. Version 2.0 requires
  <a href='https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/'>registration</a>
   and allows users to access more data more frequently. Users may add calculations and annual averages to requests, and series description information is available for many BLS surveys. Version 1.0 is a more limited API that does not require registration and is open for public use.

 The BLS Public API utilizes two HTTP request-response mechanisms to retrieve data: GET and POST. 
 <ul>
    <li>GET requests data from a specified source. <li>POST submits data to a specified resource to be processed. 
</ul>
The BLS Public Data API uses GET to request a single piece of information and POST for all other requests.
